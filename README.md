# AI Powered Coding - Live Course

This repository is used as part of an [O'Reilly](https://www.oreilly.com/) live
course named **AI-powered-Coding**, idealized by [Fernando J Vieira](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fernandojvieira/).

The proposed exercises are meant to be used as part of the course, being the code
(with its imperfections) created only for educational purposes.

## Setup

- If you have a GitHub Copilot license, enjoy the convenience of GitHub Codespaces (60
free hours per month for a 2-core instance). Simply create a new Codespace from the
repository, ensuring you select the correct branch before proceeding.
  - **It is recommended to run the build task once the Codespace finishes its initialization.**

- If you prefer local development or want to try another AI assistant, follow these steps:
  1. Install JDK 21.
  2. Have IntelliJ or Visual Studio Code with the Extension Pack for Java.
  3. For AI assistance: Install extensions for your preferred tool (e.g., Copilot, Codeium, Tabnine) and sign in if needed.
